## Why Thales?

Thales of Miletus, was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, mathematician and
astronomer from Miletus in Asia Minor (present-day Milet in Turkey). He was one
of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regard him as the
first philosopher in the Greek tradition, and he is otherwise historically
recognized as the first individual in Western civilization known to have
entertained and engaged in scientific philosophy. (Wikipedia)
